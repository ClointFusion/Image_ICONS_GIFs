												<p style="text-align: justify;color: rgb(7, 7, 24);">2020-21 has been a very successful year for the company, and we are very delighted to inform you all about it in this newsletter.

												<p style="text-align: justify;color: rgb(7, 7, 24);">ClointFusion visualized to provide solutions for a common man where a user does not need to be tech-savvy. This is where the whole journey started with a few amazing and dedicated technical heads. ClointFusion as a team diversified the whole game plan by introducing sufficient functions to develop simple, medium, and complex bots and tested them with a few existing use cases. As a part of the product development, we then introduced a monthly hackathon program to gather ideas and knowledge majorly from academics and various other sectors. Conducting Hackathon programs monthly was not an easy task however, the core team stood by the plan which in fact supplied 16 intelligent icons for the internship program so far. ClointFusion RPA product is now heading towards its crucial stage where Artificial intelligence takes place to make the mission and vision possible. ClointFusion released the beta version which is currently available in developer mode only. We provided RPA solutions to Retail wireless Business in the United States of America, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Tata Steel etc. Our reputation is our most treasured asset and everyone at ClointFusion knows that the only way to protect and improve our reputation is to exceed the customer expectations, meet our commitments and deliver excellence. By understanding, and embracing our clients' business problems, vision, project objectives and goals, we will be able to build stronger and lasting relationships that will yield long term results. This will be a year of growth and new opportunities for everyone at ClointFusion. We appreciate your continued commitment to the company and our growth. We are confident and we can make this mutually rewarding.</p>
